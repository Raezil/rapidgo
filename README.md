# RapidGo - Fast, Minimalist Web Framework for Go
RapidGo is a lightweight and high-performance web framework for building modern web applications and APIs in Go. Designed with simplicity and speed in mind, RapidGo provides an intuitive API for routing, middleware integration, and request handling while maintaining minimal overhead.

## Features
- **Fast Routing**: Built on a radix tree-based router for efficient route matching.
- **Middleware Integration** : Supports both global and group-level middleware for flexible request handling.
- **Lightweight Design** : A clean and minimalistic API that prioritizes simplicity and rapid development.
- **Environment Management** : Built-in support for loading and managing environment variables.
- **Customizable Error Responses** : Define custom "Not Found" messages or fallback behavior for unmatched routes.
- **Debugging Capabilities** : Includes a debugging mode to log registered routes and server details during development.
- **Route Grouping** : Organize routes with shared base paths and middleware for better structure and reusability.

## Installation
To install RapidGo, use `go get`:
```bash
go get github.com/rwiteshbera/rapidgo
```

---

## Quick Start
Hereâ€™s how you can quickly set up a basic web server using RapidGo:
```go
package main
import (
	"github.com/rwiteshbera/rapidgo"
)
func main() {
	router := rapidgo.New()
	// Define a simple route
	router.Get("/", func(c *rapidgo.Context) {
		c.String(200, "Hello, World!")
	})
	// Define a route with parameters
	router.Get("/user/:id", func(c *rapidgo.Context) {
		id := c.Param("id")
		c.JSON(200, map[string]string{"id": id})
	})
	// Start the server
	if err := router.Listen(); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```
Run the application:
```bash
go run main.go
```
By default, the server will start on port `8080`. You can customize the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable in terminal or in `.env` file:
```bash
PORT=3000 go run main.go
```
